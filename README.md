# mapuche-non-profit-store-and-supply-chain
A management application to empower volunteers supporting the oppressed Mapuche indigenous people in Chile. The volunteers operate a non-profit community store that sells food, such as oats, grown by the Mapuche people in exchange for money. The app will digitize supply chain tracking, store inventory management, and membership administration.
